\noindent I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my supervisor, Prof. Sudhir Malik, whose profound insight into the field, invaluable guidance, and unwavering support have been instrumental in shaping both my academic and professional growth. His perspective on the evolving landscape of research has been truly inspiring.

This work would not have been possible without the mentorship of Corrinne Mills (UIC) and Gabrielle Benelli (FNAL). Gabrielle has been an exceptional leader, generously sharing his experience with me, particularly throughout the Guest and Visitor (GV) program, where his mentorship over the course of a year greatly enriched my understanding. Similarly, Corrinne played a crucial role in deepening my knowledge, providing invaluable guidance during G\&V and beyond, always willing to offer insight and support.

I also want to extend my profound gratitude to the Ukrainian soldiers and everyone working toward Ukraine’s victory. Their resilience and dedication ensure the safety of my home, allowing me to continue my work with the hope of returning to a place of peace.

Finally, I am deeply thankful to my family and friends for their unwavering support, patience, and understanding throughout this journey.
