abstract = {The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 1034 cm−2 s−1 (1027 cm−2 s−1).  At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter.  The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4π solid angle.  Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|η| ⩽ 5) assuring very good hermeticity.  The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.}

abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider(LHC), at CERN will undergo major upgrades to be able to deliver peak instantaneous luminosities of about 5−7.5×1034cm−2s−1 by 2027. This High Luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) is expected to deliver a total of about 3000−4000fb−1 during ten years of operation. At the nominal instantaneous luminosity of the HL-LHC, a single bunch crossing will produce 140−200 proton–proton collisions. The current CMS strip tracker and the CMS Phase-1 pixel detector will not be able to survive the harsh operating conditions of the HL-LHC period. The CMS experiment will install a new silicon tracker for the HL-LHC. The Phase-2 Outer Tracker(OT) will feature increased radiation hardness, higher granularity and track separation and compatibility with higher data rates and a longer trigger latency. In addition, the OT will provide tracking information to the Level-1 trigger, allowing trigger rates to be kept at a sustainable level without sacrificing physics potential. To achieve this, the OT will be made up of modules with two closely spaced sensors read out by a single ASIC. The ASIC will correlate data from both sensors to form short track segments called stubs, to be used in tracking at Level-1. In this contribution, the design of the CMS Phase-2 OT, the technological choices and highlights of the research and development activities will be reported.}

abstract = {An all silicon pixel telescope has been assembled and used at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility (FTBF) since 2009 to provide precise tracking information for different test beam experiments with a wide range of Detectors Under Test (DUTs) requiring high resolution measurement of the track impact point. The telescope is based on CMS pixel modules left over from the CMS forward pixel production. Eight planes are arranged to achieve a resolution of less than 8μm on the 120GeV proton beam transverse coordinate at the DUT position. In order to achieve such resolution with 100×150μm2 pixel cells, the planes were tilted to 25 degrees to maximize charge sharing between pixels. Crucial for obtaining this performance is the alignment software, called Monicelli, specifically designed and optimized for this system. This paper will describe the telescope hardware, the data acquisition system and the alignment software constituting this particle tracking system for test beam users.}

  abstract     = {In 2017 a new pixel detector was installed in the CMS detector. This so-called Phase-1 pixel detector features four barrel layers in the central region and three disks per end in the forward regions. The upgraded pixel detector requires an upgraded data acquisition (DAQ) system to accept a new data format and larger event sizes. A new DAQ and control system has been developed based on a combination of custom and commercial microTCA parts. Custom mezzanine cards on standard carrier cards provide a front-end driver for readout, and two types of front-end controller for configuration and the distribution of clock and trigger signals. Before the installation of the detector the DAQ system underwent a series of integration tests, including readout of the pilot pixel detector, which was constructed with prototype Phase-1 electronics and operated in CMS from 2015 to 2016, quality assurance of the CMS Phase-1 detector during its assembly, and testing with the CMS Central DAQ. This paper describes the Phase-1 pixel DAQ and control system, along with the integration tests and results. A description of the operational experience and performance in data taking is included.}

journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {Within the CERN RD50 Collaboration, a massive R&amp;D programme is underway across experimental boundaries to develop silicon sensors with sufficient radiation tolerance. One research topic is to gain a deeper understanding of the connection between the macroscopic sensor properties such as radiation-induced increase of leakage current, doping concentration and trapping, and the microscopic properties at the defect level. RD50 also studies sensors made from p-type silicon bulk, which have a superior radiation hardness as they collect electrons instead of holes, exploiting the lower trapping probability of the electrons due to their higher mobility.  Simulations have become important to predict the performance of silicon sensors at high fluences. They can be a useful tool to explore the large parameter space of strip sensor geometries and help to explain the charge multiplication effect occuring in sensors at high radiation levels. Charge multiplication plays an important role in sensors irradiated to high fluences and is investigated in RD50. Several studies are ongoing to exploit the effect for future silicon sensors.  The latest results of the microscopic studies, the simulation activities, the performance of heavily irradiated strip sensors and the investigations on charge multiplication are presented.}
